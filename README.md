# hexsweeper
JavaScript hexagonal minesweeper game.

### Running the game
You will need to run a local http server in order to run this game locally.
I recommend using the [Atom](https://atom.io/) text editor and
installing the [atom-live-server](https://atom.io/packages/atom-live-server)
package. This will allow the image files to be accessed on your local machine.
